This is my fork of https://github.com/JaKooLit @JaKooLit's custom Hyprland Dot files, mostly worried about keybinds and window resolution scaling. Main is a copy of the original repo to allow for easy pulling of new updates, whilst the custom branch contains my keybinds / window settings, etc. As this was streamlined by claude, I will leave it's message here - 
<p>Your setup is now:                                                                                                                                                                           
  - main branch tracks origin (JaKooLit) - pull updates from here                                                                                                                                        
  - custom-dots branch tracks custom/main (your repo) - push your customizations here                                                                                                                    
  - Your repo at peytjensen/HyprlandCustomDots has a single clean commit with your full current state, no bloated history
                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  Next time you want to push updates, just git checkout custom-dots, merge/cherry-pick your changes, and push.        <p>
