This is my fork of https://github.com/JaKooLit @JaKooLit's custom Hyprland Dot files, which are beautiful for easy Arch ricing. This repo is focused on backing up personal preferences, such as rofi keybinds, workspace management, and window scaling per resolution, but feel free to use it if it matches your needs. Up to date with Hyprland 0.53.3 and the main branches' update for 0.53.3.
